# Object-detection-with-aws-rekognition

This project utilizes Python 3.10 and the AWS Rekognition service to perform object detection on a video. The aim is to detect specific objects, such as zebras, within the video frames and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Getting Started

1. **Python Version:** Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **AWS Account:** Create an AWS account and set up a user with appropriate permissions. The user should have access to the AWS Rekognition service. Generate an access key for this user.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Code:** Modify the `credentials.py` file with your AWS access key and secret key. Then, run the `main.py` script to perform object detection on the provided video.

## Directory Structure

- **data/:** Contains the output data generated by the script.
  - **imgs/:** Stores all frames extracted from the video.
  - **anns/:** Contains annotation files for each frame, specifying the detected objects and their bounding boxes.
  - **detected_frames/:** Stores frames with detected objects and bounding boxes.
- **main.py:** Python script for performing object detection.
- **credentials.py:** File for storing AWS access key and secret key.
- **zebras.mp4:** Input video file for object detection.

## Sample Video

The input video used for object detection is a recording of zebras in their natural habitat. The video contains various scenes of zebras running and moving around.

## Object Detection Video

The object detection video is the result of running the object detection script on the input video. It shows the same scenes as the sample video but with bounding boxes drawn around the detected zebras.
